# Striver A2Z DSA Practice

A personal repository for systematically solving the Data Structures & Algorithms problems from Striver’s A2Z sheet. The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills, track progress, and maintain clean, reusable code templates.

## Description
This repo contains my solutions organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.) following Striver’s A2Z DSA list. Each folder corresponds to a topic and includes:
- Problem statement link/reference.
- My solution code (e.g., in C++/Java/Python).
- A short comment or README inside that folder on the approach/complexities.
- (Optional) Test cases or instructions to run.

Use this as a structured practice log. Over time, revisit tough problems and optimize or refactor solutions.
